# front-ui
## Description:
front-ui is a template project for building user interfaces using modern web development technologies. It includes configuration files and dependencies to help you quickly set up and develop web applications with ease.

## Features:

** Webpack Configuration: The project is pre-configured with webpack to bundle and optimize your JavaScript and TypeScript files for deployment.
HTML Templating: HTML files are generated using HtmlWebpackPlugin, allowing you to create dynamic HTML templates with ease.
** Development Server: Utilize webpack-dev-server to quickly preview and develop your application in a local development environment. The server supports hot module replacement, providing a seamless development experience.
** SCSS Support: Easily style your application using SCSS syntax, which is processed and compiled into CSS during the build process. PostCSS and Autoprefixer are included to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
** Bootstrap Integration: Bootstrap is included as a dependency, providing a comprehensive set of UI components and utilities to streamline your UI development process.
** Testing with Jest: Jest is configured for testing your JavaScript and TypeScript code, enabling you to write and run tests with ease.
** TypeScript Support: TypeScript is integrated into the build process using ts-loader, allowing you to write type-safe code and catch errors early in development.

## Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies: npm install

On two sepereted terminals navigate to projects root directory:
on first terminal run npm command: npm run build:dev 
on second terminal run npm command: npm run serve 
** This is crucial when using webpack-dev-server with current configurations, serving an html file. Webpack is watching static files within the dist directory.
